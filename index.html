		<h2>About Mao and Ruffy</h2>
		<p>Mao and Ruffy are siblings from the same litter and are just 4 years old.<br>
		They are also a mix of the cat breeds Main Coon and Siberian Forest.</p>
		<p>The special thing about them is that they have the look and behaviour of a Main Coon and a Siberian, but they'll stay this small and don't grow any bigger like this breeds are normaly do. That's because, on the one side, their Dad is a Siberian and on the other side, their Mom is a Main Coon but also mixed with another unknown breed, probably the European Shorthair.</p>
